data viz bullshit

nested rows
  how does deep nesting work
    pass a kind of "path" back up i guesssssss :/

    right yeah okay
      so currently my best idea is honestly to keep track of a path
      so it's like a while current['children'] current = current['children']
      except more like a BFS inside the loop
      i mean it's just tree traversal if you think about it
        okay so....
        so that actually does work decently well, just using
          BFS
      and then for the handler you just index in to the row
      well so the handler just needs acess to the right piece of state...
        which means, yeah, indexing in
      this is maybe a decent time to not build this thing badly too
      i mean irl you would have a database
      and the database would have like
      mm yeah i can see how that sucks similarly
      i guess i don't want to deal with that either

      and then thinking at least a little long term
      if all we have is these giant objects
      is linking possible still
      well so if you create a person
      and then later want to create a company
      and those two should know they're connected
      well actually it should all be explicit
      mm maybe maybe not
      i mean yeah so you create a company
      and inside the company you create a founder
      oh yeah this whole thing
      so you create a founder
        And you're like @an
      and then some shit pops up
      and it's like
      did you mean andrew ng
      and it finds that record by....
      just searching all values fuck it
      and then name is special
